# Introduction / Problem Statement

VJ Tam Tam is a user-friendly, web-based "auto VJ" tool designed to solve the problem of needing quick, engaging, and effortless visual content for social gatherings like parties. Traditional VJ software can be complex and time-consuming to set up and manage during an event. VJ Tam Tam offers a zero-configuration solution where users can simply drop a folder of their existing photos and videos to generate an infinite, dynamic, fullscreen visual display. This eliminates the need for manual slideshow management or complicated setups, allowing hosts and guests to focus on the event itself while providing a unique visual atmosphere. The project was born out of the need for simple, effective visuals for the "Bum Bum Tam Tam" parties and aims to make this capability accessible to anyone.
