# Out of Scope Ideas / Post-MVP Exploration

_The following ideas have been recorded during the initial architectural design phase. They are considered out of scope for the MVP but are valuable considerations for future product evolution._

## Develop Custom In-House Perspective Mapping Library

- **Proposal:** Explore the development of a custom, in-house perspective mapping library to replace the MVP's reliance on the Maptastic.js library.
- **Rationale:**
  1.  **Legacy Technology:** The currently planned Maptastic.js library for MVP, while functional, has not been updated in over a decade. This presents a potential long-term risk regarding future browser compatibility, maintainability, and security.
  2.  **Deeper Control & Understanding:** A custom library would provide complete control over this core visual feature, allowing for easier integration of specific needs, potential performance optimizations tailored to VJ Tam Tam, and a modern codebase.
  3.  **User Engagement & Passion:** The user (Vibe CEO) has expressed a particular interest in this aspect of the technology, which could drive innovation and quality for this key feature.
