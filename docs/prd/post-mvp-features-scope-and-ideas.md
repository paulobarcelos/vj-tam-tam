# Post MVP Features / Scope and Ideas

- **Smarter Content Handling:**
  - Simple image tinting filters (abstract names, palette-based).
  - More advanced content analysis (e.g., basic scene/face detection) to inform content selection or sequencing.
  - Option for subtle dynamic effects on media (e.g., very slow, minimal pan/zoom or color shifts).
- **Enhanced Text Features:**
  - Smart text placement to avoid overlaying key visual elements (like faces).
  - Multiple font selection and text styling options.
  - Simple text entry animations/effects.
  - Link text color to image tint palettes.
- **Audio Reactivity:**
  - Basic beat detection to influence visual pacing or text flashes.
- **Preset Management:**
  - Ability to save and load custom projection/filter/aspect ratio presets.
  - **Shareable Configurations:** Storing settings and text entries in the URL for sharing/bookmarking (with reconciliation logic).
- **More Media Types:**
  - Support for audio-only files.
