# API Reference

VJ Tam Tam does **not** consume any external web/network APIs. [cite: 72] Its functionality relies on **Browser APIs** (e.g., `localStorage`, `FileSystemAccessAPI`, Fullscreen API, Drag and Drop API) and the **Locally Hosted Library API** of Maptastic.js. [cite: 73] These are managed via Facade modules. [cite: 74] The application does not provide any network-accessible APIs. [cite: 74] Its "internal APIs" are the public interfaces of its JavaScript ES Modules. [cite: 75]
