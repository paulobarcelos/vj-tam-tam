# Story 1.2: File Picker Dialog Media Selection

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a User
- I want to be able to select image and video files/folders using a standard file picker dialog
- so that I have an alternative way to load my media if drag-and-drop is inconvenient

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC 2.1: Given I am on the VJ Tam Tam page, when I click on a designated area or button for selecting files, then a standard operating system file picker dialog opens.
- AC 2.2: Given the file picker is open, when I select one or more supported image files (JPG, PNG, GIF, HEIC, WebP) and confirm the selection, then the application processes these files for playback.
- AC 2.3: Given the file picker is open, when I select one or more supported video files (MP4, MOV, WebM) and confirm the selection, then the application processes these files for playback.
- AC 2.4: Given the file picker is open, when I select a folder containing supported image and/or video files and confirm the selection, then the application recursively finds and processes all supported files within that folder.
- AC 2.5: Given the file picker is open, when I select a file type that is _not_ supported and confirm, then the application ignores this file **AND a toast notification appears indicating that the file type is not supported and listing the supported types.**
- AC 2.6: Given the file picker is open, when I cancel the selection, then the picker closes, and the application state remains unchanged with no error message displayed.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Context & Purpose

This story extends the media input capabilities from Story 1.1 by adding a traditional file picker interface as an alternative to drag-and-drop. It leverages the existing media processing infrastructure while introducing the FileSystemAccessAPI for enhanced file system interaction. This provides accessibility for users who prefer or need to use standard file dialogs.

### File Structure Integration

- **Primary implementation**: `src/uiManager.js` - Add file picker UI triggers and event handling
- **FileSystem interaction**: `src/facades/fileSystemFacade.js` - Extend or create FileSystemAccessAPI wrapper
- **Media processing**: `src/mediaProcessor.js` - Reuse existing file validation and processing logic
- **State management**: `src/stateManager.js` - Leverage existing media pool state management
- **Event coordination**: `src/eventBus.js` - Use established Pub/Sub for component communication

### Technical Implementation Details

#### FileSystemAccessAPI Integration

The application should use the modern FileSystemAccessAPI where available, with fallback to traditional HTML input elements:

```javascript
// Primary approach using FileSystemAccessAPI
const fileHandles = await window.showOpenFilePicker({
  multiple: true,
  types: [
    {
      description: 'Images',
      accept: {
        'image/*': ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.heic', '.webp']
      }
    },
    {
      description: 'Videos', 
      accept: {
        'video/*': ['.mp4', '.mov', '.webm']
      }
    }
  ]
})

// For folder selection
const directoryHandle = await window.showDirectoryPicker()
```

#### Fallback Implementation

Create graceful degradation for browsers without FileSystemAccessAPI support:

```javascript
// Fallback using HTML input element
const input = document.createElement('input')
input.type = 'file'
input.multiple = true
input.accept = 'image/*,video/*'
input.webkitdirectory = true // For folder selection
```

#### UI Integration Points

Per UI/UX Specification Section 5.2:

**Welcome State Integration**:
- The welcome message area ("Welcome to VJ Tam Tam, please drag and drop your photos and videos here, or click to browse, to start your performance") should be clickable to trigger file picker
- Maintain existing styling (centered, Arial Bold, white text on black background)

**Media Pool Section Integration**:
- Add file picker button in top-right of Media Pool section header
- Style consistently with UI design system (minimalist, translucent overlay)
- Position according to left drawer panel specifications

#### Reuse Existing Architecture

This story should heavily leverage the infrastructure from Story 1.1:

**File Processing**: Use the existing MediaProcessor module's file validation and media pool management logic
**Toast Notifications**: Reuse the existing ToastManager for unsupported file type feedback
**State Management**: Integrate with established StateManager patterns for media pool updates
**Event Bus**: Use existing Pub/Sub patterns for component communication

#### Error Handling Strategy

Per Operational Guidelines Section 14.3:

- **User Cancellation**: Handle AbortError from showOpenFilePicker gracefully without showing error messages
- **Permission Denied**: Show informative toast notification if user denies file access permission
- **API Unavailability**: Gracefully fallback to HTML input elements if FileSystemAccessAPI is not supported
- **File Processing Errors**: Leverage existing error handling from MediaProcessor for corrupted/unsupported files

#### Browser API Considerations

**FileSystemAccessAPI Support**:
- Available in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge)
- Not available in Firefox/Safari - requires fallback strategy
- Check for API availability: `'showOpenFilePicker' in window`

**Permission Model**:
- FileSystemAccessAPI requires user gesture (click event)
- Handles are persisted automatically by browser for future access
- May integrate with existing persistence strategy from StateManager

### Architecture Pattern Compliance

Following established patterns from `docs/component-view.md`:

- **Module Pattern**: Use ES Modules for clean separation of concerns
- **Facade Pattern**: Abstract FileSystemAccessAPI complexity through dedicated facade
- **Observer Pattern**: Leverage event bus for state change notifications between UI and MediaProcessor
- **State Management**: Follow established mutator patterns for media pool updates

### Integration with Existing Modules

**UIManager Integration**:
- Add click event handlers for file picker triggers
- Maintain existing idle/active state behavior
- Follow established UI state management patterns

**MediaProcessor Integration**:
- Reuse existing `addFiles()` method for processing selected files
- Leverage existing file type validation constants and functions
- Maintain additive behavior for media pool (files added, not replaced)

**StateManager Integration**:
- Use existing media pool state structure
- Follow established persistence patterns
- Trigger state change notifications via event bus

### Performance Considerations

- Process selected files asynchronously to prevent UI blocking
- Implement batch processing for large file selections
- Show appropriate loading indicators during file processing
- Handle memory management for file object references

### Testing Strategy

Per Operational Guidelines Section 13:

**Unit Tests**:
- FileSystemAccessAPI facade functionality
- File picker UI event handling
- Error handling scenarios (cancellation, permission denied)

**Integration Tests**:
- UI Manager + FileSystemAccessAPI facade interaction
- FileSystemAccessAPI facade + MediaProcessor integration
- Fallback behavior when API is unavailable

**Manual E2E Tests**:
- File picker dialog functionality in supported browsers
- Folder selection and recursive processing
- Fallback behavior in unsupported browsers
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
