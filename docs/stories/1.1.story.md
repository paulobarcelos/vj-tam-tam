# Story 1.1: Drag and Drop Media Files

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a User
- I want to be able to drop image and video files/folders onto the application window
- so that I can easily load my media

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC 1.1: Given I am on the VJ Tam Tam page, when I drag one or more image files (JPG, PNG, GIF, HEIC, WebP) from my file system and drop them anywhere onto the application window, then the application processes these files for playback.
- AC 1.2: Given I am on the VJ Tam Tam page, when I drag one or more video files (MP4, MOV, WebM) from my file system and drop them anywhere onto the application window, then the application processes these files for playback.
- AC 1.3: Given I am on the VJ Tam Tam page, when I drag a folder containing supported image and/or video files from my file system and drop it anywhere onto the application window, then the application recursively finds and processes all supported files within that folder.
- AC 1.4: Given I am on the VJ Tam Tam page, when I drag a file type that is _not_ supported (e.g., a `.txt` or `.pdf` file) and drop it, then the application ignores this file **AND a toast notification appears indicating that the file type is not supported and listing the supported types (JPG, PNG, GIF, HEIC, WebP, MP4, MOV, WebM).**
- AC 1.5: Given I am on the VJ Tam Tam page, when I drag files/folders, then the application window provides a visual indication (e.g., a border change or overlay) that it is a valid drop target.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Context & Purpose

This story implements the primary media input mechanism for VJ Tam Tam. It establishes the foundation for user interaction with the application by enabling users to easily load their media files through the intuitive drag-and-drop interface. This functionality is critical for the overall user experience as specified in the PRD Section 4.

### File Structure References

- **Main implementation**: `src/uiManager.js` - UI event handling and drag-and-drop logic
- **Media processing**: `src/mediaProcessor.js` - File validation and media pool management
- **State management**: `src/stateManager.js` - Managing media pool state
- **Event coordination**: `src/eventBus.js` - Pub/Sub for component communication
- **HTML structure**: `index.html` - Main application stage and UI elements

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Drag and Drop API Implementation

Use the HTML5 Drag and Drop API with the following event handlers:

```javascript
// Prevent default behavior and enable drop
window.addEventListener('dragover', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  e.dataTransfer.dropEffect = 'copy'
})

window.addEventListener('drop', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  // Process dropped files/folders
})
```

#### File Type Validation

Implement validation using both file extensions and MIME types as defined in PRD Section 4:

**Supported Image Types**: JPG, PNG, GIF, HEIC, WebP
**Supported Video Types**: MP4, MOV, WebM

Create validation constants and functions in the MediaProcessor module.

#### Folder Processing

Use `DataTransferItem.webkitGetAsEntry()` for recursive folder traversal:

```javascript
for (const item of e.dataTransfer.items) {
  const entry = item.webkitGetAsEntry()
  if (entry.isDirectory) {
    // Recursively process directory
  } else if (entry.isFile) {
    // Process individual file
  }
}
```

#### Visual Feedback Requirements

Per UI/UX Specification Section 3 and 5.2:

- Stage (main display area) should provide visual indication when files are dragged over the window
- Media Pool area within the left drawer should provide enhanced highlight when files are hovered directly over it
- Use border changes or overlays as specified in the design system (Section 2)

#### State Management Integration

Following the architecture pattern from `docs/Architechture.md#6`:

- Use the Pub/Sub pattern for decoupled communication between UI Manager and Media Processor
- Update state through State Manager with proper mutators
- Ensure persistence to localStorage for media references (if FileSystemAccessAPI is available)

#### Error Handling

Per Operational Guidelines Section 14.3:

- Wrap file processing in try/catch blocks
- Use console.error() for logging processing failures
- Display toast notifications for unsupported file types
- Gracefully handle permission denied scenarios

#### Toast Notification System

Implement minimalist toast notifications per UI Design System Section 2:

- Non-intrusive, brief duration
- Black semi-transparent background with white text
- Position appropriately to not interfere with media playback
- Include supported file type list in error messages

### Architecture Pattern Compliance

This implementation should follow the established patterns from `docs/Architechture.md#5`:

- **Module Pattern**: Use ES Modules for clean separation
- **Observer Pattern**: Leverage event bus for state change notifications
- **Facade Pattern**: Abstract complex file handling through MediaProcessor

### Integration Points

- **State Manager**: Media pool updates, persistence coordination
- **Media Processor**: File validation, media item creation
- **UI Manager**: Visual feedback, event handling
- **Event Bus**: Component communication and state change notifications

### Performance Considerations

- Process files asynchronously to prevent UI blocking
- Implement batch processing for large folder drops
- Provide progress indication for large file sets
- Handle memory management for file object references

### Testing Strategy

Per Operational Guidelines Section 13:

- **Unit Tests**: File validation functions, folder traversal logic
- **Integration Tests**: UI Manager + Media Processor interaction
- **Manual E2E Tests**: Actual drag-drop with various file types and folder structures
- Use test media files from `assets/` directory
