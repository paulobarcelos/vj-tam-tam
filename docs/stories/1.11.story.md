# Story 1.11: Welcome Message Display for Empty Media Pool

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a User
- when the media pool is empty
- I want to see an informative message guiding me on how to add media
- so that I know how to get started.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC 11.1: Given the application loads and the media pool is empty (either initially or after clearing media), then a specific text message, like "Welcome to VJ Tam Tam, please drag and drop your photos and videos here, or click to browse, to start your performance", is displayed prominently on the stage area.
- AC 11.2: When the user adds media to the empty pool, the welcome/instruction text disappears.
- AC 11.3: The welcome/instruction text is styled clearly and centered on the stage.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Implement clear media pool functionality for testing (Prerequisite for AC validation)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Add "Clear Media" button to UI (temporary or permanent based on product decision)
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Implement `clearMediaPool()` method in StateManager
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Handle cleanup of media object URLs to prevent memory leaks
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Emit appropriate events when media pool is cleared
  - [x] Subtask 1.5: Ensure playback engine stops when media pool is cleared

- [x] Task 2: Validate current welcome message implementation (AC: 11.1, 11.3)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Verify welcome message displays on initial app load with empty media pool
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Verify welcome message displays after media pool is cleared (requires Task 1)
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Confirm message text matches AC 11.1 specification
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Validate welcome message styling and positioning
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Test welcome message clickability for file browsing

- [x] Task 3: Validate welcome message hide/show behavior (AC: 11.2)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Test welcome message hides when media is added via drag-and-drop
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Test welcome message hides when media is added via file picker
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Test welcome message shows when all media is removed/cleared (requires Task 1)
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Test welcome message behavior with temporary vs persistent files
  - [x] Subtask 3.5: Test welcome message behavior with files that need permission

- [x] Task 4: Enhance welcome message functionality if needed (AC: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3)
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Refactor hardcoded welcome text to use centralized strings (if not done)
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Improve welcome message styling for better visibility and UX
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Add accessibility attributes for screen readers
  - [x] Subtask 4.4: Optimize welcome message responsive behavior

- [x] Task 5: Test edge cases and integration (All ACs)
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Test welcome message with restored media pool on page reload
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Test welcome message during file processing delays
  - [x] Subtask 5.3: Test welcome message with error states (failed file loads)
  - [x] Subtask 5.4: Test welcome message interaction with playback engine state

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Context & Purpose

This story validates and enhances the welcome message functionality that guides users when the media pool is empty. The welcome message is the first interaction point for new users and provides clear guidance on how to add media to start the VJ experience.

**⚠️ Critical Dependency**: Full validation of AC 11.2 requires the ability to clear the media pool, which doesn't currently exist in the application. Task 1 addresses this prerequisite.

### Current Implementation Analysis

Based on codebase analysis, the welcome message system appears to be largely implemented:

✅ **Existing Implementation:**
- HTML structure: `#welcome-message` div in `app/index.html` with proper content
- CSS styling: Welcome message positioned in stage area (needs verification)
- JavaScript logic: `updateWelcomeMessageVisibility()`

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: 
Claude Sonnet 4

### Completion Notes List
- Successfully validated existing welcome message implementation
- Added clear media pool functionality including UI button and confirmation dialog
- Confirmed all acceptance criteria are met:
  - AC 11.1: Welcome message displays prominently on stage when media pool is empty ✅
  - AC 11.2: Welcome message disappears when media is added and reappears when cleared ✅
  - AC 11.3: Welcome message is properly styled and centered on stage ✅
- All functionality uses centralized strings per operational guidelines
- Comprehensive event-driven architecture ensures proper synchronization
- Clear media functionality enables full testing of welcome message behavior

### Change Log
