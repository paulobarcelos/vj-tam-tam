# Story 3.4: Media Pool Square Thumbnails with Visual Indicators

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a User
- I want the media pool to display my files as square thumbnails with clear visual indicators
- so that I can easily identify and manage my media collection.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- **AC 4.1:** Given the UI-UX-Spec.md Section 5.2 media pool specifications, media items display as square thumbnails using CSS object-fit cover to fill the square area while cropping as needed.
- **AC 4.2:** Video files display with a play icon overlay to distinguish them from images, as specified in UI-UX-Spec.md Section 5.2.
- **AC 4.3:** The media pool uses a responsive grid layout that reflows based on available space, as specified in UI-UX-Spec.md Section 5.2.
- **AC 4.4:** Hover states reveal a delete button ("×") for individual media items, and the grid reflows when items are removed, as specified in UI-UX-Spec.md Section 5.2.
- **AC 4.5:** Video thumbnails display duration information as a small overlay (e.g., "2:34") positioned in a corner of the thumbnail.
- **AC 4.6:** Media thumbnails show filename and file size information in a tooltip on hover (e.g., "video.mp4 • 15.2 MB"), with no filename display elsewhere in the UI.

## Dev Notes

### Current Implementation Analysis

**Existing Media Pool Structure:**
- UIManager.updateMediaPoolDisplay() currently handles media item display
- StateManager.getMediaPool() provides media items array
- Media items contain: id, name, type, mimeType, size, file, url, addedAt
- Current implementation likely uses simple list or basic grid layout

**UI-UX-Spec Requirements:**
- Section 5.2 specifies square thumbnails with object-fit: cover
- Video indicators must be play icon overlays
- Responsive grid layout with reflow capability
- Hover states for delete functionality
- Consistent with brutalist minimalism design (Arial Bold, black/white colors)

**Integration Points:**
- UIManager.updateMediaPoolDisplay() method needs significant updates
- CSS styling needs to implement responsive grid system
- Event handling for delete buttons must integrate with StateManager
- Thumbnail generation may need HTML5 Canvas for consistent square display

**Technical Considerations:**
- CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive layout
- CSS object-fit: cover for proper image/video cropping
- Thumbnail generation from video files using video element
- Video duration extraction using HTML5 video loadedmetadata event
- Hover state management for delete button visibility and tooltips
- Grid reflow animations for smooth item removal
- File size formatting (bytes to KB/MB conversion)
- Tooltip positioning and z-index management
- Duration overlay positioning with proper background contrast

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest Integration Test: location: `/tests/stories/media-pool-thumbnails.test.js`
- [ ] Cypress E2E: location: `/e2e/epic-3/media-pool-display.spec.js`

Manual Test Steps:

- Add various media files (images and videos) with different aspect ratios
- Verify all items display as square thumbnails with proper cropping
- Confirm video files show play icon overlay
- Verify video files display duration overlay (e.g., "2:34") in corner
- Test hover states reveal delete buttons
- Test hover states display filename and file size tooltips (e.g., "video.mp4 • 15.2 MB")
- Verify grid reflows properly when items are removed
- Test responsive behavior by resizing drawer/window
- Confirm tooltips position correctly and don't interfere with UI elements
- Test duration extraction works for various video formats and lengths
- Confirm visual consistency with UI-UX-Spec brutalist minimalism
