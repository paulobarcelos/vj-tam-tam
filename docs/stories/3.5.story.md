## Dev Notes

### Current Styling Analysis

**Existing Styling Structure:**
- App uses CSS classes for component styling
- ToastManager exists with current notification system
- UIManager handles component rendering and styling
- Various form controls exist (sliders, inputs, buttons) with potentially inconsistent styling

**UI-UX-Spec Requirements:**
- Section 2: Brutalist minimalism with Arial Bold typography
- Section 2: Limited color palette (black #000000, white #FFFFFF)
- Section 5.4: Toast notifications bottom-center positioned
- Section 8: Accessibility requirements for keyboard navigation and visual feedback
- Consistent spacing, sizing, and interaction patterns throughout

**Design System Implementation:**
- Create base CSS classes for all interactive elements
- Implement consistent hover, focus, and active states
- Standardize spacing, padding, and margin values
- Ensure all components follow the same visual hierarchy

**Integration Points:**
- ToastManager styling updates
- UIManager component generation methods
- CSS class structure organization
- Event handling for accessibility features

**Technical Considerations:**
- CSS custom properties for consistent values
- Focus management for keyboard navigation
- Touch target sizing for mobile devices
- High contrast ratios for accessibility
- Consistent animation/transition timings

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest Integration Test: location: `/tests/stories/component-styling.test.js`
- [ ] Cypress E2E: location: `/e2e/epic-3/styling-consistency.spec.js`

Manual Test Steps:

- Navigate through all interface sections and verify consistent button styling
- Test all form controls (sliders, inputs, toggles) for consistent appearance and behavior
- Trigger toast notifications of different types and verify bottom-center positioning
- Test keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
- Verify focus states are visible and consistent
- Test on different screen sizes to ensure responsive consistency
- Use accessibility tools to verify contrast ratios and screen reader compatibility

### Agent Model Used: Claude Sonnet 4

### Debug Log References

No debug logging required for this story - implementation was straightforward following UI-UX-Spec requirements.

### Completion Notes List

**Story Successfully Completed** - All 6 tasks and 24 subtasks implemented:

1. **Brutalist Button Design System**: Created comprehensive `.btn` class system with variants (`.btn--secondary`, `.btn--danger`, `.btn--icon`, `.btn--small`, etc.) following UI-UX-Spec brutalist minimalism principles
2. **Toast Notification Repositioning**: Successfully moved toast notifications from top-right to bottom-center positioning per UI-UX-Spec Section 5.4
3. **Accessibility Compliance**: All buttons meet 44px minimum touch target requirements with proper focus states and ARIA support
4. **Legacy Code Migration**: Successfully updated all static HTML buttons and dynamically created buttons in UIManager to use new standardized classes
5. **Form Control Consistency**: Existing form controls (sliders, inputs) already followed UI-UX-Spec standards - verified compliance
6. **Integration Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite covering all ACs in `/tests/stories/component-styling.test.js`

**No Scope Deviations**: All implementation exactly matches story requirements and UI-UX-Spec Section 2, 5.4, and 8.
