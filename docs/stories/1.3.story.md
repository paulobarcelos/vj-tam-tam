# Story 1.3: Add to Existing Media Pool

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As the Application
- I want to add newly dropped/selected files to the existing media pool, rather than replacing it
- so that users can build their media collection incrementally.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC 3.1: Given the media pool is empty, when I drop/select one or more supported files/folders, then the media pool is populated with the valid files from my selection.
- AC 3.2: Given the media pool already contains media, when I drop/select additional supported files/folders, then the new valid files from my selection are added to the _existing_ media pool. The previously loaded media remains in the pool.
- AC 3.3: Given the media pool has been updated by adding new files, when playback is active, the new media becomes eligible for random selection and display alongside the older media.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Modify media processing logic to append new media to the existing pool (AC: 3.1, 3.2)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Update `MediaProcessor.addFiles()` to receive current media pool state.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Implement logic to concatenate new valid media items with the existing list.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Implement logic to ignore duplicate files based on their path/name when adding to the pool.
- [x] Task 2: Update State Manager to reflect the additive media pool (AC: 3.1, 3.2)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Ensure `StateManager`'s media pool structure supports additive updates.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Implement or verify mutator function in `StateManager` to correctly add new media items.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Trigger state change notification via Event Bus after media pool is updated.
- [x] Task 3: Verify Playback Engine correctly uses the updated media pool (AC: 3.3)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Ensure `PlaybackEngine` listens for media pool state changes via Event Bus.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Verify `PlaybackEngine`'s random selection logic considers all items in the updated media pool.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Context & Purpose

This story builds directly upon the media loading functionality (drag-and-drop from 1.1, file picker from 1.2). The core requirement here is to change the behavior from replacing the media pool with new inputs to adding new inputs to the existing pool. This allows users to load media from multiple sources and incrementally build their performance set.

### File Structure Integration

- **Primary logic modifications**: `src/mediaProcessor.js` will be the main focus for changing the handling of new files.
- **State updates**: `src/stateManager.js` will need to handle the state mutation for the media pool.
- **Communication**: `src/eventBus.js` will be used to notify other components (like the Playback Engine and UI) of the media pool changes.

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Media Pool Structure

The media pool is stored within the `StateManager`. The structure for individual media items is defined in `docs/data-models.md#PersistedMediaItem`. The `StateManager` holds an array of these `PersistedMediaItem` objects.

#### Additive Logic

The `MediaProcessor` currently handles the validation and initial processing of file inputs. Its `addFiles()` method will need to be modified. Instead of creating a _new_ media pool array, it should receive the _current_ media pool array from the `StateManager`, add the newly processed valid files to it, and then pass the *combined* array back to the `StateManager` via a dedicated mutator function.

Consideration should be given to handling duplicate file inputs. A simple approach is to ignore new files if a file with the same name/path already exists in the pool. This behavior should be clarified in the `Tasks / Subtasks`.

#### State Management

The `StateManager` uses a Custom Centralized State pattern (`docs/component-view.md#State-Management-Pattern`). It needs a mutator function specifically for adding items to the media pool array. This function should ensure the new items are added correctly and then trigger the state change notification via the `EventBus` (`docs/component-view.md#Observer-Pattern`).

#### Playback Engine Interaction

The `PlaybackEngine` listens for changes to the media pool state via the `EventBus`. This mechanism should already be in place from previous stories. The implementation needs to ensure that when the media pool state changes, the `PlaybackEngine` updates its internal reference to the media pool and that its random selection logic operates on the *entire*, updated list of media items (AC 3.3).

#### Error Handling

Per `docs/operational-guidelines.md#Error-Handling-Strategy`, file processing errors (like unsupported types) should still result in a toast notification and the file being ignored. This story's focus is on the _addition_ logic, not changing how individual files are processed or validated.

### Architecture Pattern Compliance

- **Module Pattern:** Continue using ES Modules (`import`/`export`) for code organization.
- **Observer Pattern:** Leverage `eventBus.js` for communication between `MediaProcessor`, `StateManager`, and `PlaybackEngine`.
- **State Management:** Adhere to the `StateManager` pattern for modifying the media pool state.

### Integration with Existing Modules

- **MediaProcessor:** Modify `addFiles`.
- **StateManager:** Add/update a mutator for media pool addition.
- **EventBus:** Publish media pool update events.
- **PlaybackEngine:** Subscribe to media pool update events and use the latest pool.

### Performance Considerations

Adding a large number of files to the pool might impact performance, especially if the pool grows very large. Ensure that state updates and playback selection remain efficient with larger arrays. Consider potential future optimizations if needed, but for this story, focus on correctness of the additive logic.

### Testing Strategy

Per `docs/operational-guidelines.md#Testing-Strategy`:

**Unit Tests**:
- `MediaProcessor.addFiles()` logic: Test with empty pool, with existing items, with duplicates, with mixed valid/invalid new inputs.
- `StateManager` mutator for media pool: Test adding items, ensure state updates correctly.

**Integration Tests**:
- Test the flow from `MediaProcessor` adding files -> `StateManager` updating -> `EventBus` notifying -> `PlaybackEngine` receiving update.

**Manual E2E Tests**:
- Drag and drop files/folders multiple times and verify all previously loaded media remains and new media is added.
- Use file picker multiple times and verify additive behavior.
- Verify playback cycles through all loaded media (both old and newly added).

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

### Completion Notes List

- Draft created based on Epic 1, story 1.3.
- Synthesized technical guidance from Data Models, Component View, Project Structure, and Operational Guidelines.
- Defined initial tasks/subtasks.
- Duplicate file inputs (identified by path/name) should be ignored. The `MediaProcessor.addFiles()` method should filter out any new files that are already present in the existing media pool before adding the remaining unique files.
- **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**: Created StateManager module for centralized media pool management with additive behavior
- **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**: Modified MediaProcessor to use StateManager instead of internal Map-based storage
- **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**: Updated UIManager to listen for StateManager events and use centralized state
- **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**: Added comprehensive unit tests for StateManager additive behavior
- **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**: Updated MediaProcessor tests to work with StateManager integration
