# Story 3.1: Left Drawer as Translucent Overlay

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As a User
- I want the left drawer to appear as a translucent overlay on top of the stage
- so that the visual content remains the primary focus while controls are accessible.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- **AC 1.1:** Given the UI-UX-Spec.md Section 3 specifications, the left drawer is positioned as an overlay on top of the stage rather than as a sidebar taking up separate space.
- **AC 1.2:** The left drawer has a translucent (semi-transparent black) background allowing the stage content behind it to be partially visible, as specified in UI-UX-Spec.md Section 3.
- **AC 1.3:** The stage occupies the full browser window dimensions (100vw × 100vh) with the drawer overlaid on top, as specified in UI-UX-Spec.md Section 3.
- **AC 1.4:** The drawer positioning and sizing follows the responsive behavior specified in UI-UX-Spec.md Section 7, adapting appropriately for different screen sizes.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Context & Implementation Overview

This story transforms the current sidebar-based left drawer into a translucent overlay positioned on top of the stage, following the brutalist minimalism design specified in UI-UX-Spec.md. The current implementation uses a flexbox layout where the drawer takes up separate space (300px width) alongside the stage. The new implementation requires the stage to occupy the full viewport while the drawer overlays on top with a semi-transparent background.

### Current Implementation Analysis

**Current Layout Structure:**
- `#app` container uses `display: flex` with drawer and stage as siblings
- Left drawer has `width: 300px` and `background-color: #222`
- Stage uses `flex: 1` to fill remaining space
- Layout behaves as a traditional sidebar + main content arrangement

**Files Requiring Modification:**
- **Primary:** `app/assets/css/style.css` - Main styling changes for overlay implementation
- **Secondary:** `app/index.html` - Potential minor structural adjustments if needed
- **Verification:** `app/src/uiManager.js` - Ensure existing functionality remains intact

### CSS Implementation Strategy

**Key Styling Changes Required:**

1. **App Container Layout:**
```css
#app {
  position: relative;  /* Change from display: flex */
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
}
```

2. **Stage Full Viewport:**
```css
.stage {
  position: absolute;  /* Change from flex: 1 */
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: #111;
  /* Remove flex properties */
}
```

3. **Left Drawer Overlay:**
```css
.left-drawer {
  position: absolute;  /* Change from default positioning */
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 300px;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);  /* Semi-transparent black */
  z-index: 100;  /* Ensure overlay positioning */
  /* Remove border-right and flex properties */
}
```

### UI-UX-Spec.md Compliance References

**Section 3: Layout Structure**
- Left drawer as "overlay on top of the stage" (AC 1.1)
- "Translucent (e.g., semi-transparent black)" background (AC 1.2)
- Stage content "behind it to be partially visible" (AC 1.2)
- Stage occupies "full browser window (100vw × 100vh)" (AC 1.3)

**Section 7: Responsive Behavior**
- Referenced in AC 1.4 for adaptive sizing
- Current context shows mobile breakpoint at 768px in existing CSS
- Drawer should maintain usability across screen sizes

### Testing Considerations

**Visual Verification Points:**
1. Stage content (images, videos, welcome message) visible through translucent drawer
2. Drawer controls remain fully readable and functional
3. No visual artifacts or overlap issues
4. Consistent behavior across different browsers
5. Responsive scaling on various screen sizes

**Functional Verification Points:**
1. All existing drag-and-drop behavior continues to work
2. File picker functionality remains intact
3. Advanced controls toggle and interactions work properly
4. Media playback display fills entire stage properly
5. Welcome message centering and interaction works on full-viewport stage

### Integration Notes

**StateManager Integration:**
- No changes required to state management logic
- Existing UI state persistence should continue working

**EventBus Integration:**
- No changes required to event handling
- Existing drag-and-drop and file handling events should continue working

**MediaProcessor Integration:**
- No changes required to media processing logic
- Stage media display should automatically benefit from full viewport sizing

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **Very small screens:** Drawer might need width adjustment or different positioning
2. **Touch devices:** Overlay interaction patterns may differ from desktop
3. **High contrast modes:** Translucency effect might need accessibility considerations
4. **Browser compatibility:** CSS positioning and translucency support across browsers

### Performance Considerations

- CSS transforms and opacity changes are generally hardware-accelerated
- No significant performance impact expected from layout changes
- Translucency effects should not impact media playback performance

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude Sonnet 4`

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**
- Successfully transformed the application layout from a flexbox sidebar to an overlay system
- Stage now occupies full viewport (100vw × 100vh) with drawer overlaid on top
- Applied semi-transparent black background (rgba(0,0,0,0.8)) to the drawer for translucency effect
- Updated responsive design to make drawer full width on mobile devices (768px breakpoint)
- Made advanced controls sections translucent to maintain visual consistency
- All existing functionality (drag-and-drop, media display, controls) continues to work correctly
- All tests pass successfully (411 tests passing)
- No linting errors introduced

**Key Technical Changes:**
1. **App Container:** Changed from `display: flex` to `position: relative` with full viewport dimensions
2. **Stage:** Changed from `flex: 1` to `position: absolute` covering full viewport
3. **Left Drawer:** Changed to `position: absolute` with `z-index: 100` and `rgba(0,0,0,0.8)` background
4. **Advanced Controls:** Made header and section backgrounds translucent
5. **Responsive:** Updated mobile breakpoint to use `width: 100vw` instead of `250px`

**Visual Verification Completed:**
- Translucent overlay effect properly shows stage content beneath
- Drawer controls remain fully readable and functional
- Welcome message, media display, and drag-and-drop work correctly on full-viewport stage
- Responsive behavior works correctly on different screen sizes
