# Story 2.1: Random Segment Selection from Media

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As the Application
- I want to select a random segment from the currently chosen media item (image or video) for display
- so that the playback is constantly varied and unpredictable.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC 1.1: Given playback is active, when a new media item is selected for display, the application determines a random start point within the media's total duration.
- AC 1.2: The random start point is calculated such that a segment of the configured duration can be played without exceeding the media's total duration.
- AC 1.3: The calculated segment duration for display is a random value between the configured minimum and maximum duration settings (with the configurable minimum and maximum duration settings initially defaulting to 5 seconds each, and the overall configurable range for these settings being 1 to 30 seconds).
- AC 1.4: Given an image is selected, the application displays the full image for the calculated random segment duration.
- AC 1.5: Given a video is selected, the application starts playback of the video from the random start point for the calculated random segment duration.
- AC 1.6 (Video Offset Edge Case - Calculate Valid Range): Given a video with total duration `D`, configured "skip start" `SS`, configured "skip end" `SE`, and selected segment duration `SD` (where `min_duration <= SD <= max_duration`), the application determines the valid range of possible start points `[ValidStartMin, ValidStartMax]` for the segment. This range is initially constrained by `SS` (segment must start >= `SS`) and `D - SE - SD` (segment must end <= `D - SE`).
- AC 1.7 (Video Offset Edge Case - Fallback Logic): If the initially calculated valid range `[ValidStartMin, ValidStartMax]` results in `ValidStartMin > ValidStartMax` (meaning no valid start point exists considering all offsets and duration), the application attempts the following fallback steps until a valid range is found:
  - **Fallback 1:** Recalculate the range ignoring the "skip end" (`SE`) constraint.
  - **Fallback 2:** If Fallback 1 still results in `ValidStartMin > ValidStartMax`, recalculate the range ignoring _both_ the "skip start" (`SS`) and "skip end" (`SE`) constraints.
- AC 1.8 (Video Offset Edge Case - Selection): Once a valid range `[ValidStartMin, ValidStartMax]` is found (either through the initial calculation or a fallback step), the application selects a random start point for the video segment within this valid range.
- AC 1.9 (Video Offset Edge Case - Notification): If Fallback 2 is triggered (meaning both start and end offsets had to be ignored for this specific video), a toast notification appears informing the user that the configured video offsets were too large for a particular video and were temporarily ignored for that playback.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Context & Purpose

This story introduces randomized segment playback to VJ Tam Tam, transforming the application from displaying full media items to showing random segments of configurable duration. This creates the "eternal slideshow" effect where content is constantly varied and unpredictable.

### Current Implementation Analysis

**Existing Playback Structure:**
- `PlaybackEngine` class in `app/src/playbackEngine.js` handles current media display
- Fixed durations: `IMAGE_DISPLAY_DURATION: 4000ms`, `VIDEO_MAX_DURATION: 30000ms`
- Current cycling logic in `startCycling()`, `transitionToNextMedia()`, and scheduling methods
- State management via `StateManager` with localStorage persistence

**Key Files to Modify:**
- `app/src/playbackEngine.js` - Core playback logic enhancement
- `app/src/utils/mediaUtils.js` - New segment calculation utilities
- `app/src/constants/playbackConfig.js` - Configuration updates
- `app/src/stateManager.js` - Settings data model extension

### Segment Calculation Logic

**Duration Calculation:**
```javascript
// Random duration between min and max (both inclusive)
const segmentDuration = Math.random() * (maxDuration - minDuration) + minDuration;
```

**Video Range Calculation with Fallbacks:**
```javascript
// Initial range: start >= skipStart, end <= totalDuration - skipEnd
let validStartMin = skipStart;
let validStartMax = totalDuration - skipEnd - segmentDuration;

// Fallback 1: Ignore skipEnd if no valid range
if (validStartMin > validStartMax) {
  validStartMax = totalDuration - segmentDuration;
}

// Fallback 2: Ignore both offsets if still no valid range
if (validStartMin > validStartMax) {
  validStartMin = 0;
  validStartMax = totalDuration - segmentDuration;
  // Trigger toast notification for user
}
```

### Video Playback Implementation

**Current Video Element Setup:**
- Video elements created in `createVideoElement()` with muted autoplay
- Duration monitoring via `timeupdate` event listener
- Current max duration enforcement: `VIDEO_MAX_DURATION`

**Required Enhancements:**
1. Set `video.currentTime = calculatedStartPoint` after `loadedmetadata` event
2. Replace max duration logic with segment duration tracking
3. Use precise timing for segment end detection: `currentTime >= startPoint + segmentDuration`
4. Ensure immediate transition without waiting for video natural end

### State Management Integration

**Data Model Extension:**
```javascript
// Extend ApplicationSettings in stateManager
segmentSettings: {
  minDuration: 5,     // seconds (default 5s)
  maxDuration: 5,     // seconds (default 5s)  
  skipStart: 0,       // seconds (default 0s)
  skipEnd: 0          // seconds (default 0s)
}
```

**Settings Access Pattern:**
- Use `stateManager.getSegmentSettings()` for current configuration
- Ensure proper defaults if settings don't exist (backward compatibility)
- Settings will be configurable via UI in future stories (Epic 2, Stories 3-5)

### Error Handling & User Feedback

**Toast Notifications:**
- Use existing `toastManager` for offset fallback notifications (AC 1.9)
- Follow established error patterns in current PlaybackEngine
- Add appropriate strings to `constants/strings.js`

**Console Logging:**
- Log segment calculation details for debugging
- Follow existing logging patterns: descriptive messages with context
- Use appropriate log levels: `console.log()` for info, `console.warn()` for issues

### Performance Considerations

**Video Seeking:**
- Setting `currentTime` is generally fast but may cause brief delays on first seek
- Consider progressive enhancement: start with basic implementation, optimize if needed
- Monitor for seeking accuracy - browsers may not seek to exact frame

**Memory Management:**
- No additional memory overhead from segment logic
- Existing media cleanup patterns remain unchanged
- Segment calculations are stateless and lightweight

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Focus on pure functions: segment duration calculation, range validation, start point selection
- Test edge cases: zero-duration videos, negative offsets, ranges where no valid segment exists
- Mock video duration metadata for testing video-specific logic

**Integration Tests:**
- Test PlaybackEngine with various segment configurations
- Verify proper event emission and state updates
- Test fallback scenarios with realistic video durations

### Backward Compatibility

**Graceful Defaults:**
- If segment settings don't exist, use safe defaults (5s min/max, no offsets)
- Existing media pool and playback behavior should work unchanged
- New segment logic should be additive, not breaking existing functionality

### Future Considerations

This story focuses on the core segment calculation and playback logic. Future stories in Epic 2 will add:
- UI controls for segment duration configuration (Story 3)
- Advanced video offset controls (Stories 4-5)
- Video segment playback consistency improvements (Story 2)

The implementation should be designed to easily integrate with these upcoming UI enhancements.
