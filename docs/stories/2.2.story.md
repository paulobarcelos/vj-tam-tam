# Story 2.2: Video Segment Playback Consistency

## Status: Completed

## Story

- As the Application
- I want to ensure video segments play correctly for their specified duration starting from the randomly selected point
- so that video playback is consistent with images.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC 2.1: Given a video is selected for playback at a specific random start point and for a specific segment duration, the video element's playback begins precisely at the calculated start point.
- AC 2.2: The video playback continues from the start point for the exact duration specified for the segment.
- AC 2.3: When the video playback reaches the end of the segment duration, the application immediately (hard cut) transitions to the next media item.
- AC 2.4: If the video's natural end is reached before the segment duration is complete, the application immediately transitions to the next media item when the video ends.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Context & Purpose

This story focuses on enhancing the reliability and precision of video segment playback implemented in Story 2.1. While the basic segment calculation and playback logic exists, this story addresses timing precision issues and ensures video segments play exactly as specified, providing consistency with image display timing.

### Current Implementation Analysis

**Existing Video Segment Logic (from Story 2.1):**
- Video segment parameters are calculated using `getVideoSegmentParameters()` in `mediaUtils.js`
- Start point is set via `video.currentTime = segmentParams.startPoint` in `loadedmetadata` event
- Segment duration is scheduled using `scheduleVideoSegmentTransition(segmentParams.segmentDuration)`
- Natural video end is handled via the `ended` event listener

**Current Issues to Address:**
1. **Timing Precision:** Current implementation uses setTimeout for segment duration, which may drift
2. **Seeking Reliability:** Setting `currentTime` may not always seek precisely due to video keyframes
3. **Edge Case Handling:** Limited fail-safes for corrupt videos or seeking failures
4. **Consistency:** Video timing may not match image timing precision

### Key Files to Modify

**Primary:**
- `app/src/playbackEngine.js` - Enhance `createVideoElement()` method and video timing logic
- `app/src/constants/playbackConfig.js` - Add video-specific timing configuration

**Secondary:**
- `app/src/utils/mediaUtils.js` - Add timing utilities if needed
- Test files for new video timing functionality

### Video Timing Enhancement Strategy

**Precise Segment End Detection:**
```javascript
// Replace setTimeout-based transitions with timeupdate monitoring
video.addEventListener('timeupdate', () => {
  const segmentParams = video._segmentParams
  if (segmentParams && this.isCyclingActive) {
    const currentTime = video.currentTime
    const segmentEndTime = segmentParams.startPoint + segmentParams.segmentDuration
    
    // Check if segment duration is complete (with small tolerance for timing precision)
    if (currentTime >= segmentEndTime - 0.1) {
      this.transitionToNextMedia()
    }
  }
})
```

**Enhanced Seeking Reliability:**
```javascript
// Add seeking state tracking and retry mechanism
video.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', () => {
  const segmentParams = getVideoSegmentParameters(video.duration, segmentSettings)
  video._segmentParams = segmentParams
  video._seekTarget = segmentParams.startPoint
  video._seekAttempts = 0
  
  this.seekToStartPoint(video, segmentParams.startPoint)
})

// Verify seeking accuracy and retry if needed
video.addEventListener('seeked', () => {
  const target = video._seekTarget
  const actual = video.currentTime
  const tolerance = 0.5 // Allow 0.5 second tolerance
  
  if (Math.abs(actual - target) > tolerance && video._seekAttempts < 3) {
    video._seekAttempts++
    video.currentTime = target
  }
})
```

**Segment State Management:**
```javascript
// Track video segment state on the video element
video._segmentState = {
  startPoint: segmentParams.startPoint,
  segmentDuration: segmentParams.segmentDuration,
  segmentEndTime: segmentParams.startPoint + segmentParams.segmentDuration,
  isMonitoring: true,
  fallbackUsed: segmentParams.fallbackUsed
}
```

### Performance Considerations

**Event Listener Optimization:**
- Use `timeupdate` event sparingly by checking timing only during active monitoring
- Remove event listeners when video elements are cleaned up
- Add debouncing if timeupdate fires too frequently

**Memory Management:**
- Clear video state objects when transitioning to prevent memory leaks
- Ensure proper cleanup of timing-related data stored on video elements

### Error Handling & Edge Cases

**Seeking Failures:**
- Implement retry mechanism for seeking with exponential backoff
- Fall back to playing from current position if seeking repeatedly fails
- Log seeking issues for debugging without disrupting playback

**Video Format Compatibility:**
- Handle cases where timeupdate events may not fire consistently
- Add fallback timer as backup for segment duration enforcement
- Test with various video formats (MP4, WebM, etc.)

**Short Video Edge Cases:**
- Handle videos shorter than minimum segment duration
- Ensure proper behavior when video ends before segment duration
- Test with videos close to or shorter than 1 second

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing Approach:**
- Mock video element with controllable currentTime and duration properties
- Simulate seeking behavior and timeupdate events
- Test timing calculations and state management in isolation

**Integration Testing Focus:**
- Test with actual video files of various durations and formats
- Verify timing precision with different segment duration settings
- Test edge cases: very short videos, seeking near video end, corrupted files

**Manual Testing Validation:**
- Use browser developer tools to monitor video.currentTime during playback
- Verify visual consistency between video and image segment durations
- Test with projection mapping to ensure timing doesn't affect visual quality

### Backward Compatibility

**Preserving Existing Functionality:**
- Maintain existing video playback for non-cycling scenarios
- Keep compatibility with video offset settings (skipStart, skipEnd)
- Ensure toast notifications continue to work for fallback scenarios

**Configuration Flexibility:**
- Add timing tolerance settings that can be adjusted if needed
- Maintain existing segment calculation logic from Story 2.1
- Keep fallback to setTimeout if timeupdate monitoring fails

### Integration with Future Stories

This story prepares the foundation for:
- UI controls for segment duration configuration (Story 2.3)
- Advanced video offset controls (Stories 2.4-2.5)
- Performance optimizations for longer playback sessions

The enhanced timing system should be designed to work seamlessly with the upcoming UI controls and settings management.

### Browser Compatibility Considerations

**HTML5 Video API:**
- `timeupdate` event is well-supported across modern browsers
- `seeked` event handling may vary slightly between browsers
- `loadedmetadata` timing can differ between browsers and video formats

**Performance Variations:**
- Some browsers may have slight differences in seeking precision
- Mobile browsers may handle video timing differently
- Test on multiple browsers to ensure consistent behavior

### Debugging & Development Tools

**Console Logging Strategy:**
- Log segment timing details during development
- Track seeking accuracy and timing precision
- Monitor event firing patterns for optimization

**Development Aids:**
- Add debug mode that shows segment timing information
- Consider temporary UI indicators for segment boundaries during testing
- Use browser performance tools to monitor video element behavior
