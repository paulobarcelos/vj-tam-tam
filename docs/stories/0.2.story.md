# Story 0.2: Download and Place Maptastic.js

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a Developer
- I need to manually download the `Maptastic.js` library and place it in the correct project directory
- so that it is available for the application's projection mapping features.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC 2.1: The JavaScript library file is downloaded from the official repository URL: `https://github.com/glowbox/maptasticjs/blob/master/build/maptastic.min.js`.
- AC 2.2: The downloaded file is renamed to `maptastic.js` and placed inside the `/lib/` directory at the project root.
- AC 2.3: The final path to the file is exactly `./lib/maptastic.js`, as specified in the project structure.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Download maptastic.min.js from the provided URL (AC: 2.1)
- [ ] Task 2: Rename maptastic.min.js to maptastic.js (AC: 2.2)

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is a manual task for the developer. The agent cannot automate the download due to security restrictions. The file must be downloaded manually and placed in the specified location.

### Context & Purpose

Maptastic.js is the library used for the application's [projection mapping features](docs/PRD.md#4.5-Projection-Mapping), a key requirement for VJ Tam Tam. This task ensures the library is available in the designated location (`./lib/`) as specified by the [Project Structure](docs/project-structure.md#7) for the application to utilize it.

### Required File

The file to be downloaded is `maptastic.min.js` from the official repository URL: `https://github.com/glowbox/maptasticjs/blob/master/build/maptastic.min.js`.
