## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is a manual task for the developer. The agent cannot automate the download due to security restrictions. The file must be downloaded manually and placed in the specified location.

### Context & Purpose

Maptastic.js is the library used for the application's [projection mapping features](docs/PRD.md#4.5-Projection-Mapping), a key requirement for VJ Tam Tam. This task ensures the library is available in the designated location (`./lib/`) as specified by the [Project Structure](docs/project-structure.md#7) for the application to utilize it.

### Required File

The file to be downloaded is `maptastic.min.js` from the official repository URL: `https://github.com/glowbox/maptasticjs/blob/master/build/maptastic.min.js`.
