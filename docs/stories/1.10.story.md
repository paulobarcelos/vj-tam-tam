# Story 1.10: Implement Media Pool Cycling and Continuous Playback

## Status: Review

## Story

- As the Application
- I want to cycle through the full images and videos in the media pool (initially just showing each for a duration, segments come later)
- so that the basic visual stream is established.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC 10.1: Given playback is active and the media pool is not empty, then the application randomly selects a media item from the pool.
- AC 10.2: Given a media item is selected, it is displayed fullscreen using the 'cover' behavior (as per AC 4.x).
- AC 10.3: Given an image is displayed, it remains visible for a fixed duration (e.g., 4 seconds - we'll make this configurable later).
- AC 10.4: Given a video is displayed, it plays from its beginning to its end (or a fixed maximum duration if the video is very long - this will be refined in the next Epic).
- AC 10.4a: When a video is played, its audio track should remain muted.
- AC 10.5: After the display duration for the current media item is complete (or the video finishes), the application immediately (hard cut) transitions to a _new_ randomly selected media item from the pool.
- AC 10.6: The process of random selection and display continues indefinitely as long as the media pool is not empty.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Context & Purpose

This story implements the core cycling functionality that transforms the application from displaying a single media item to creating a continuous visual stream. The current `PlaybackEngine` can display individual media items but lacks the timing and transition logic needed for automatic cycling.

### Current PlaybackEngine Analysis

The existing `app/src/playbackEngine.js` provides:
- ✅ Media display with fullscreen cover behavior (`displayMedia()`, `createImageElement()`, `createVideoElement()`)
- ✅ Event-driven architecture with EventBus integration
- ✅ State management integration for media pool updates
- ✅ Auto-playback initiation when media pool is populated
- ❌ **Missing**: Cycling logic, transition timing, random selection

### Key Implementation Areas

#### 1. Random Selection Logic
```javascript
// Add to PlaybackEngine class
getRandomMediaItem() {
  const mediaPool = stateManager.getMediaPool()
  const usableMedia = filterUsableMedia(mediaPool) // From utils
  
  if (usableMedia.length === 0) return null
  if (usableMedia.length === 1) return usableMedia[0]
  
  // Avoid immediate repetition
  const availableMedia = this.currentMediaItem 
    ? usableMedia.filter(item => item.id !== this.currentMediaItem.id)
    : usableMedia
    
  return availableMedia[Math.floor(Math.random() * availableMedia.length)]
}
```

#### 2. Timing Configuration
Add configurable timing constants to `src/constants/playbackConfig.js`:
```javascript
export const PLAYBACK_CONFIG = {
  IMAGE_DISPLAY_DURATION: 4000, // 4 seconds in milliseconds
  VIDEO_MAX_DURATION: 30000,    // 30 seconds max
  TRANSITION_TYPE: 'hard-cut'   // Future: 'fade', 'slide', etc.
}
```

#### 3. Cycling State Management
```javascript
// Add to PlaybackEngine constructor
this.cyclingTimer = null
this.currentMediaId = null
this.isPlaybackActive = false
this.isCyclingActive = false
```

#### 4. Image Display Enhancement
```javascript
createImageElement(mediaItem) {
  const img = this.createImageElement(mediaItem) // Call existing method
  
  img.addEventListener('load', () => {
    this.scheduleImageTransition()
  })
  
  return img
}

scheduleImageTransition() {
  this.clearCyclingTimer()
  this.cyclingTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    this.transitionToNextMedia()
  }, PLAYBACK_CONFIG.IMAGE_DISPLAY_DURATION)
}
```

#### 5. Video Playback Enhancement
```javascript
createVideoElement(mediaItem) {
  const video = this.createVideoElement(mediaItem) // Call existing method
  
  video.addEventListener('ended', () => {
    this.transitionToNextMedia()
  })
  
  // Maximum duration fallback
  this.cyclingTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    this.transitionToNextMedia()
  }, PLAYBACK_CONFIG.VIDEO_MAX_DURATION)
  
  return video
}
```

### Integration Points

1. **State Management**: Hook into existing `handleMediaPoolUpdate()` to restart cycling when media pool changes
2. **Event Bus**: Use existing EventBus patterns for cycling state changes
3. **UI Manager**: The `updateWelcomeMessageVisibility()` method should work seamlessly with cycling
4. **String Constants**: Use existing `STRINGS.SYSTEM_MESSAGES.playbackEngine.*` patterns for logging

### Critical Considerations

1. **Timer Management**: Always clean up timers to prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior
2. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle media load failures by automatically progressing to next item
3. **State Consistency**: Ensure cycling state is properly managed when media pool changes
4. **Performance**: Random selection should be efficient even with large media pools
5. **Edge Cases**: Handle single-item pools, empty pools, and media pool clearing during cycling

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for random selection logic
- Integration tests for image/video timing
- End-to-end tests for continuous cycling behavior
- Edge case testing (single item, pool clearing, errors)
- Performance testing with large media pools

- **Component View**: `docs/component-view.md` - PlaybackEngine integration patterns
- **State Management**: `docs/data-models.md` - Media pool structure and state patterns
- **Event System**: `docs/sequence-diagrams.md` - Event flow for media updates
