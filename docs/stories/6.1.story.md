# Story 6.1: Advanced Panel Hidden By Default

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As the Application
- I want the advanced controls panel to be hidden by default
- so that the main interface remains simple for most users and follows progressive disclosure principles

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

### AC 1.1: Default Hidden State on Fresh Load
**Given** the application loads for the first time AND there is no saved state for the advanced panel's visibility in `localStorage` (key: `vjtamtam.ui.advancedPanelVisible`)  
**Then** the HTML element containing the advanced controls UI panel is not visible to the user  
**And** the element has CSS `display: none` or equivalent hiding mechanism

### AC 1.2: Default Projection Mode Inactive on Fresh Load  
**Given** the application loads for the first time AND there is no saved state for Projection Setup Mode in `localStorage`  
**Then** the application is not in Projection Setup Mode  
**And** the stage maintains responsive sizing (`width: 100vw`, `height: 100vh`)

### AC 1.3: CSS-Based Hiding Implementation
**Given** the advanced controls panel is in its default hidden state  
**Then** the hiding is achieved using standard CSS display properties  
**And** hidden controls cannot be interacted with  
**And** the hiding mechanism prevents screen readers from accessing hidden content

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement advanced panel default hidden state (AC: 1.1, 1.3)
  - [ ] Create CSS classes for hidden/visible states
  - [ ] Set default HTML structure with `display: none`
  - [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance for hidden content
- [ ] Set up localStorage key structure (AC: 1.1)
  - [ ] Define `vjtamtam.ui.advancedPanelVisible` key handling
  - [ ] Implement default value logic when key doesn't exist
- [ ] Ensure projection mode defaults to inactive (AC: 1.2)
  - [ ] Verify stage maintains responsive sizing on load
  - [ ] Ensure no Maptastic handles are active by default

## Dev Notes

### Key Implementation Details
- **Target Element**: `#advanced-controls-section` within left drawer
- **CSS Strategy**: Use `display: none` for complete hiding
- **localStorage Key**: `vjtamtam.ui.advancedPanelVisible` (boolean)
- **Default Stage**: Responsive `100vw × 100vh` sizing
- **UI-UX-Spec Compliance**: Section 4 (toggle behavior), Section 5.2 (drawer structure)

### Integration Points
- **StateManager**: Manages panel visibility state
- **UIManager**: Controls DOM visibility
- **StorageFacade**: Handles localStorage operations

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 80%
- [ ] Jest Integration Test (Test Location): `/tests/stories/6.1-advanced-panel-default/`
- [ ] Cypress E2E: location: `/e2e/epic-6/advanced-panel-default.test.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Clear localStorage and reload app - verify advanced panel is hidden
- Verify projection mode is inactive and stage is responsive
- Verify hidden panel cannot be accessed via keyboard navigation
